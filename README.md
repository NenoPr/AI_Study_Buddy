## Summary

Studdybuddy is a Chatgpt powered notes manager where you can organise and keep your study notes with the help of AI.
You can use AI to summarzie your notes, make quizzes or ask it questions and make notes out of responses.

## Usage

The app is straightforward and simple to use, create notes, manage them and utilise AI powered features to make studying easier.


## About the Project

I desired to create an app with AI integration and the idea of an AI helping you with studying resonated the most.
The project uses the following stack: React for front-end, Node.js and express for the back-end, and postgresql for database managment.
